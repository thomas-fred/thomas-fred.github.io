I'm a research software engineer living in Oxford and working at the [Environmental Change Institute](https://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/) on a variety of projects to do with climate change risk.

I had a previous life in fusion energy research. At the [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy](https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/) I studied the [sources of uncertainty in modelling neutron behaviour](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23579/). More recently I left fusion and decided to work on renewable energy generation planning and integration at the [Institute for Environmental Analytics](https://www.the-iea.org/).

Outside of work I like:
- learning how things work
- [getting in the sea](https://magicseaweed.com/Croyde-Beach-Surf-Report/7/)
- riding my bike to the places in between
- [mapping land ownership](https://www.whoownsoxford.org/)
- fixing things
- trying to play guitar
- looking up
